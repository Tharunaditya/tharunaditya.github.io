# The Life of a Packet

To secure a network, you must understand the flow of data at a microscopic level.

## The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is the map of the internet.

1.  **Physical**: Cables, WiFi.
2.  **Data Link**: MAC Addresses, Switching.
3.  **Network**: IP Addresses, Routing.
4.  **Transport**: TCP/UDP, Ports.
5.  **Session**
6.  **Presentation**
7.  **Application**: HTTP, DNS, SSH.

## The 3-Way Handshake

Every reliable connection starts with a polite conversation using flags:

1.  **SYN** (Synchronize): "Hi, I'd like to talk."
2.  **SYN-ACK** (Synchronize-Acknowledge): "Sure, I'm listening."
3.  **ACK** (Acknowledge): "Great, let's start."

> [!WARNING]
> If a server receives thousands of SYN packets but never gets an ACK, it can crash. This is a **SYN Flood** attack.

## Analyzing Traffic

We will be using **Wireshark** extensively in this series to visualize these concepts.

### Up Next

In Part 2: **Subnetting** and why it's the most hated yet important topic in networking.
