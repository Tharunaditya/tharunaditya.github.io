## The Nervous System of the Digital World

Attackers live on the network. Whether it involves exfiltrating data, pivoting between servers, or launching a Denial of Service, every action involves packets moving across wires. To secure an infrastructure (or hack it), you must understand the **physics of data transmission**.

You cannot protect what you cannot see. And to see the network, we must understand the language it speaks: **Protocols**.

## The Map: The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is not just a textbook concept; it is the mental map every security engineer uses to diagnose problems. It divides network communication into 7 distinct layers.

Why 7 layers? Because debugging "The Internet is broken" is impossible. Debugging "Layer 1 is fine, but Layer 3 is unreachable" is actionable.

### The 7 Layers (Top-Down)

1.  **Application (Layer 7)**: What the user sees. HTTP (Web), SMTP (Email), SSH.
    *   *Attack Vector*: SQL Injection, Phishing.
2.  **Presentation (Layer 6)**: Translation and Encryption. JPG, ASCII, TLS/SSL.
    *   *Attack Vector*: Malformed SSL Handshakes.
3.  **Session (Layer 5)**: Maintaining connections. "Stay logged in".
    *   *Attack Vector*: Session Hijacking.
4.  **Transport (Layer 4)**: The Delivery Service. TCP and UDP. Ports live here.
    *   *Attack Vector*: Flooding attacks (SYN Flood).
5.  **Network (Layer 3)**: Routing. IP Addresses. Routers live here.
    *   *Attack Vector*: IP Spoofing, Route Hijacking.
6.  **Data Link (Layer 2)**: Local delivery. MAC Addresses. Switches live here.
    *   *Attack Vector*: MAC Flooding, ARP Spoofing.
7.  **Physical (Layer 1)**: The physics. Cables, WiFi waves, Fiber optics.
    *   *Attack Vector*: Wiretapping, cutting cables.

> **Hacker Tip:** Most "Network Attacks" happen at Layers 2, 3, and 4. Most "Web Attacks" happen at Layer 7.

## TCP/IP: The Real Internet

While OSI is the theory, **TCP/IP** is the implementation. The most critical concept for a security engineer to grasp is the **Three-Way Handshake**.

Before any data is sent over TCP (reliable connection), a connection must be established.
1.  **SYN** (Synchronize): Client says "Hello, I want to talk."
2.  **SYN-ACK** (Synchronize-Acknowledge): Server says "I hear you, let's talk."
3.  **ACK** (Acknowledge): Client says "Great, connection established."

**Why does this matter?**
A **SYN Flood Attack** (DoS) works by sending thousands of Step 1s (SYN) but never sending Step 3 (ACK). The server waits for the ACKs that never come, holding memory open until it crashes. By understanding the handshake, we understand the attack.

## Seeing the Matrix: Wireshark

We don't take anyone's word for it; we look at the packets. **Wireshark** is the microscope for networks. It allows us to capture traffic and dissect it frame by frame.

When you open Wireshark, you aren't just seeing "data"; you are seeing the raw truth of network behavior. Malware communicating with a C2 server, cleartext passwords moving over HTTP, or a hacker scanning your ports—it all shows up in the packet capture (PCAP).

### What's Next?
In this series, we will move from theory to practice. We will capture live traffic, analyze malicious packets, and learn how to configure firewalls to block them.

**Next Part:** We will install Wireshark and dissect our first HTTP and DNS packets.

To secure a network, you must understand the flow of data at a microscopic level.

## The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is the map of the internet.

1.  **Physical**: Cables, WiFi.
2.  **Data Link**: MAC Addresses, Switching.
3.  **Network**: IP Addresses, Routing.
4.  **Transport**: TCP/UDP, Ports.
5.  **Session**
6.  **Presentation**
7.  **Application**: HTTP, DNS, SSH.

## The 3-Way Handshake

Every reliable connection starts with a polite conversation using flags:

1.  **SYN** (Synchronize): "Hi, I'd like to talk."
2.  **SYN-ACK** (Synchronize-Acknowledge): "Sure, I'm listening."
3.  **ACK** (Acknowledge): "Great, let's start."

> [!WARNING]
> If a server receives thousands of SYN packets but never gets an ACK, it can crash. This is a **SYN Flood** attack.

## Analyzing Traffic

We will be using **Wireshark** extensively in this series to visualize these concepts.
