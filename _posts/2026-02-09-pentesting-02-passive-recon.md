# The 80% Rule

In Part 1, we established the penetration testing methodology. Now we enter the most critical phase—**Reconnaissance**. Ask any professional pentester, and they'll tell you: reconnaissance is 80% of the job. The more you know about your target before launching a single scan, the more surgical your attack can be.

**Passive Reconnaissance** is intelligence gathering without directly interacting with the target's systems. You leave no logs, trigger no alerts, and remain completely invisible.

---

## Why Passive Recon Matters

Imagine two scenarios:

**Scenario A**: You run Nmap against a company's IP range. Their SIEM triggers. Security team investigates. Your IP is blocked. Engagement compromised.

**Scenario B**: You spend two days gathering publicly available information. You find an employee's GitHub with hardcoded credentials, an old subdomain running a vulnerable app, and the company's cloud provider from job postings. You craft a targeted attack with minimal noise.

Passive recon transforms a loud breach attempt into a precision strike.

## OSINT: Open Source Intelligence

OSINT is the foundation of passive reconnaissance. It involves collecting data from publicly accessible sources:

*   Company websites
*   Social media
*   Public records
*   Search engines
*   Code repositories
*   DNS records
*   Leaked databases

### The OSINT Mindset

Think like a stalker (ethically). Every piece of information is a puzzle piece:
*   That LinkedIn profile reveals the tech stack.
*   That error message in a tweet exposes the server version.
*   That PDF metadata contains the author's username.

## Google Dorking: Weaponizing Search

Google is the world's most powerful reconnaissance tool. **Google Dorks** are advanced search operators that uncover hidden information.

### Essential Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `site:` | Limit to specific domain | `site:target.com` |
| `filetype:` | Search for file types | `filetype:pdf` |
| `inurl:` | Keywords in URL | `inurl:admin` |
| `intitle:` | Keywords in page title | `intitle:"index of"` |
| `intext:` | Keywords in body text | `intext:password` |
| `-` | Exclude results | `site:target.com -www` |

### Dangerous Dorks

```
# Find exposed configuration files
site:target.com filetype:env OR filetype:config OR filetype:yml

# Find login portals
site:target.com inurl:login OR inurl:admin OR inurl:portal

# Find directory listings
site:target.com intitle:"index of" "parent directory"

# Find exposed documents
site:target.com filetype:pdf OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:docx

# Find subdomains
site:*.target.com -www

# Find AWS S3 buckets
site:s3.amazonaws.com "target"
```

### Google Hacking Database (GHDB)

The [Exploit-DB GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) contains thousands of pre-built dorks for finding:
*   Vulnerable servers
*   Exposed webcams
*   Database dumps
*   Sensitive directories

---

## Subdomain Enumeration

Subdomains are treasure troves. Companies often forget about old subdomains running outdated software.

### Passive Tools

**Sublist3r**
```bash
python sublist3r.py -d target.com -o subdomains.txt
```

**Amass (Passive Mode)**
```bash
amass enum -passive -d target.com
```

**crt.sh (Certificate Transparency)**
```bash
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.target.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sort -u
```

**SecurityTrails**
API access to historical DNS records and subdomains.

---

## Email Harvesting

Valid email addresses enable phishing attacks and credential stuffing.

### theHarvester
```bash
theHarvester -d target.com -b google,linkedin,twitter -l 500
```

### Hunter.io
Web-based tool that finds email patterns: `firstname.lastname@target.com`

### Phonebook.cz
Free email and subdomain search from leaked datasets.

---

## Technology Stack Discovery

Knowing what technologies a target uses helps identify vulnerabilities.

### Wappalyzer
Browser extension that identifies CMS, frameworks, servers, and libraries.

### BuiltWith
Web service showing historical technology usage.

### WhatWeb
```bash
whatweb target.com
```

### HTTP Headers
```bash
curl -I https://target.com
# Look for: Server, X-Powered-By, X-AspNet-Version
```

---

## Social Media Intelligence

Employees are a goldmine of information.

### LinkedIn
*   Job postings reveal tech stack requirements.
*   Employee profiles show internal tools ("Experienced with Jira, Confluence, Jenkins").
*   Org charts for social engineering.

### Twitter/X
*   Developers venting about bugs.
*   Screenshots with internal information.
*   Announcements about new infrastructure.

### GitHub
*   Company repositories with leaked secrets.
*   Employee personal repos with work-related code.
*   Commit history with removed credentials (they're still in history).

```bash
# Search GitHub for secrets
trufflehog github --org=target-org
```

## Shodan: The Search Engine for Hackers

**Shodan** indexes internet-connected devices—servers, webcams, industrial systems, IoT.

### Basic Queries
```
# Find all target IP assets
org:"Target Company"

# Find specific services
hostname:target.com port:22

# Find vulnerable services
vuln:CVE-2021-44228 org:"Target Company"

# Find exposed databases
port:27017 org:"Target Company"
```

### Shodan Dorks
```
# Exposed MongoDB
"MongoDB Server Information" port:27017

# Exposed Elasticsearch
port:9200 "elastic indices"

# Vulnerable Exchange servers
http.title:"Outlook" "X-OWA-Version"
```

---

## Wayback Machine: The Internet's Memory

The [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) archives old versions of websites. Forgotten pages, removed content, and old endpoints are all preserved.

### Use Cases
*   Find old admin panels removed from current site.
*   Discover deprecated APIs still active.
*   View historical robots.txt for hidden directories.

```bash
# Automate with waybackurls
echo target.com | waybackurls | sort -u > urls.txt
```

---

## Leaked Credentials

Databases are breached constantly. Credentials get dumped online.

### Have I Been Pwned
Check if emails appear in known breaches.

### DeHashed / Intelligence X
Search leaked databases for target domain credentials.

### Caution
Using leaked credentials without authorization is illegal. This information is for **understanding your exposure** or with explicit permission.

---

## Putting It Together: A Recon Report

After passive recon, you should have:

1.  **Attack Surface**: All subdomains, IPs, and endpoints.
2.  **Technology Stack**: Servers, frameworks, CMS, third-party services.
3.  **Email Addresses**: For phishing or credential attacks.
4.  **Usernames**: From social media, GitHub, metadata.
5.  **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Old software versions, exposed services.
6.  **Organizational Structure**: Key employees, reporting chains.

Document everything. In a professional engagement, this becomes part of your final report.

---

## Legal Reminder

Passive reconnaissance is generally legal—you're accessing public information. However:
*   Don't access leaked credentials for unauthorized access.
*   Don't scrape sites in violation of ToS (gray area).
*   Always have written authorization for the engagement.

**Next Part:** We move from observation to interaction—**Active Reconnaissance** with port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability discovery.
