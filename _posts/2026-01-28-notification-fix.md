# Neural Link Established

**Connection Confirmed.**

If you are receiving this via a Push Notification, the automated GitHub Action pipeline is successfully patched and operational.

### System Upgrades
- **Push Notifications**: Now fire automatically upon deployment of new intelligence.
- **SecBot v1.2**: Optimized for mobile and fully context-aware.

### Verify Context
Ask the bot:
> "What is the status of the Notification Link?"

It should correctly identify this article and confirm the system status.
