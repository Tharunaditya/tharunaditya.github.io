# Systems Fully Operational

**Broadcast Verified.**

The notification automation pipeline has been successfully patched to handle differential updates. This confirms that:

1.  **Creation Events**: New Intelligence Reports (Posts) trigger immediate broadcasts.
2.  **Deletion Events**: Removing old data does NOT trigger false alarms or errors.

### SecBot Instruction
Ask the bot:
> "Is the broadcast system active?"

It should confirm that **"All systems are green"** based on the context of this log.

*This concludes the system integration testing.*
