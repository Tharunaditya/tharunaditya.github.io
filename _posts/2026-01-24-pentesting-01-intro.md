# The Ethical Hacking Mindset

Welcome to the **Complete Penetration Testing** series. In this journey, we will transform your understanding of systems from "how do they work?" to "how can they break?".

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is the authorized simulation of cyberattacks on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.

> [!NOTE]
> The key difference between a malicious hacker and a penetration tester is **permission**. Always ensure you have written authorization before testing any system.

## The PTES Standard

We will follow the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** throughout this series:

1.  **Pre-engagement Interactions**: Defining scope and rules of engagement.
2.  **Intelligence Gathering**: OSINT and reconnaissance.
3.  **Threat Modeling**: Identifying assets and potential attackers.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis**: Finding weaknesses.
5.  **Exploitation**: Validating vulnerabilities.
6.  **Post Exploitation**: Determining the value of the compromise.
7.  **Reporting**: Translating findings into business value.

## Setting Up Your Lab

Before we proceed to Part 2, ensure you have:

*   **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS** installed (Virtual Machine recommended).
*   A target machine (like Metasploitable 2 or OWASP Juice Shop).
*   A willingness to learn and break things!

### Next Steps

In Part 2, we will dive deep into **Passive Reconnaissance** using OSINT tools.
