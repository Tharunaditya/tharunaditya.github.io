## Thinking Like an Attacker

Cybersecurity is often described as a chess game, but that analogy is flawed. In chess, both players see the board. In cybersecurity, the defender must protect every piece, while the attacker only needs to find one weak square.

Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is the art of **simulating an attack** to find those weak squares before the real adversaries do. It is not just about running tools like Metasploit or Nmap; it is a rigorous methodology of thinking, probing, and documenting.

### Vulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing

*   **Vulnerability Assessment**: A broad scan. "You have 50 unlocked doors." It identifies potential issues but doesn't check if they can actually be exploited.
*   **Penetration Testing**: The deep dive. "I found an unlocked door, walked in, bypassed the security camera, and successfully opened the safe." It proves the *impact* of a vulnerability.

## The Penetration Testing Lifecycle (PTES)

Professional hacking isn't chaos; it's structured. We follow the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**.

### 1. Pre-engagement Interactions
Before typing a single command, we define the rules. scope, legal boundaries, and "Rules of Engagement" (RoE).
*   *What are we testing?* (IPs, Domains)
*   *When are we testing?* (To specific hours?)
*   *What is off-limits?* (Do not touch the production DB!)

### 2. Intelligence Gathering (Reconnaissance)
This is 80% of the job. We learn everything about the target.
*   **Passive Recon**: Gathering info without touching the target (Google Dorks, LinkedIn, Shodan). The target doesn't know you are watching.
*   **Active Recon**: Engaging the target (Port scanning, DNS transfers). The target might see you in their logs.

### 3. Threat Modeling
We analyze the data. "Given they use an old Apache server on Port 80, and their developers post Python code on GitHub, where is the most likely entry point?" We map out attack vectors.

### 4. Vulnerability Analysis
We scan for known weaknesses (CVEs). Is that Apache version vulnerable to Log4Shell? specific misconfigurations?

### 5. Exploitation
The "Hacking" part. We use the vulnerability to gain access. This could be launching a buffer overflow payload or guessing a weak password.

### 6. Post-Exploitation
We are in. Now what?
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Can we go from a web user to Root/Admin?
*   **Pivot**: Can we use this machine to jump to other secure servers in the internal network?
*   **Persistence**: ensuring we can get back in later.

### 7. Reporting
The most important part. If you can't explain it to the business, you haven't provided value. A report details *what* was found, *how* it was exploited, the *business impact*, and *how to fix it*.

## The Legal Importance

**Permission is the difference between a job and a jail sentence.**

Never scan, poke, or probe a network without explicit, written written authorization. In this series, we will be building our own **Home Labs** (using Virtual Machines) to practice these skills safely.

### Our Toolkit
Over this series, we will master industry-standard tools:
*   **Kali Linux**: The OS of choice.
*   **Nmap**: The network mapper.
*   **Burp Suite**: The web proxy for app testing.
*   **Metasploit**: The exploitation framework.

But remember: **Tools don't hack; people do.** The tool is just an extension of your knowledge.

**Next Part:** We will set up our virtualization lab and execute our first **Passive Reconnaissance** mission.

Welcome to the **Complete Penetration Testing** series. In this journey, we will transform your understanding of systems from "how do they work?" to "how can they break?".

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is the authorized simulation of cyberattacks on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.

> [!NOTE]
> The key difference between a malicious hacker and a penetration tester is **permission**. Always ensure you have written authorization before testing any system.

## The PTES Standard

We will follow the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** throughout this series:

1.  **Pre-engagement Interactions**: Defining scope and rules of engagement.
2.  **Intelligence Gathering**: OSINT and reconnaissance.
3.  **Threat Modeling**: Identifying assets and potential attackers.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis**: Finding weaknesses.
5.  **Exploitation**: Validating vulnerabilities.
6.  **Post Exploitation**: Determining the value of the compromise.
7.  **Reporting**: Translating findings into business value.

## Setting Up Your Lab

Before we proceed to Part 2, ensure you have:

*   **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS** installed (Virtual Machine recommended).
*   A target machine (like Metasploitable 2 or OWASP Juice Shop).
*   A willingness to learn and break things!

### Next Steps

In Part 2, we will dive deep into **Passive Reconnaissance** using OSINT tools.
