# Reconnaissance Techniques for Ethical Hackers

Welcome to **Part 2** of our Penetration Testing Fundamentals series! In this chapter, we'll explore reconnaissance techniques - the critical first phase of any penetration test.

## What is Reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance (or "recon") is the process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization before launching an attack. It's often said that **good reconnaissance is 90% of a successful penetration test**.

## Types of Reconnaissance

### Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information **without directly interacting** with the target. This keeps your activities undetected.

#### Tools for Passive Recon:
- **WHOIS databases** - Domain registration info
- **Google Dorking** - Advanced search operators
- **Shodan** - Search engine for Internet-connected devices
- **theHarvester** - Email and subdomain enumeration
- **Maltego** - Visual link analysis

### Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves **direct interaction** with the target system, which can be detected by security monitoring tools.

#### Tools for Active Recon:
- **Nmap** - Network scanning and service detection
- **Netcat** - Banner grabbing
- **DNSenum** - DNS enumeration
- **Nikto** - Web server scanning

## OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

OSINT is the collection and analysis of publicly available information. Here are some key techniques:

### Social Media Intelligence
- LinkedIn for employee information
- Twitter for company updates
- Facebook for organizational structure

### Website Analysis
```bash
# Example: Using theHarvester
theHarvester -d target.com -b google -l 500

# DNS enumeration
dig target.com ANY
nslookup target.com
```

### Subdomain Enumeration
```bash
# Using subfinder
subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt

# Using amass
amass enum -d target.com
```

## Practical Exercise

Try this reconnaissance workflow on your own lab environment:

1. Start with WHOIS lookup
2. Enumerate subdomains
3. Check Shodan for exposed services
4. Use Google Dorking for sensitive files
5. Document all findings

## What's Next?

In **Part 3**, we'll cover **Scanning & Enumeration**, including:
- Port scanning techniques
- Service version detection
- Vulnerability scanning
- Network mapping
