# Scanning and Enumeration with Nmap

Welcome to **Part 3** of our Penetration Testing Fundamentals series! Now that we've gathered information through reconnaissance, it's time to actively scan and enumerate our targets.

## Understanding Port Scanning

Port scanning is the process of checking which ports on a target system are open, closed, or filtered. This helps identify:
- Available services
- Potential entry points
- Security misconfigurations

## Nmap: The Swiss Army Knife of Network Scanning

Nmap (Network Mapper) is the industry-standard tool for network discovery and security auditing.

### Basic Nmap Scans

```bash
# Simple ping scan
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# TCP SYN scan (stealth scan)
nmap -sS target.com

# Full port scan
nmap -p- target.com

# Service version detection
nmap -sV target.com
```

### Advanced Scanning Techniques

#### OS Detection
```bash
nmap -O target.com
```

#### Aggressive Scan
```bash
nmap -A target.com
```

#### Script Scanning (NSE)
```bash
# Vulnerability scan
nmap --script vuln target.com

# Default scripts
nmap -sC target.com
```

## Enumeration Techniques

After identifying open ports, we need to enumerate services:

### SMB Enumeration
```bash
nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 445 target.com
enum4linux -a target.com
```

### Web Server Enumeration
```bash
nikto -h http://target.com
dirb http://target.com
```

### DNS Enumeration
```bash
nmap --script dns-zone-transfer -p 53 target.com
```

## Stealth and Evasion

To avoid detection by IDS/IPS systems:

```bash
# Slow scan with timing
nmap -T2 target.com

# Decoy scanning
nmap -D RND:10 target.com

# Fragment packets
nmap -f target.com
```

## Documenting Your Findings

Always document:
- Open ports and services
- Service versions
- Operating system details
- Potential vulnerabilities
- Interesting configurations

## What's Next?

In **Part 4**, we'll cover **Exploitation Techniques**, including:
- Metasploit Framework
- Exploit development
- Privilege escalation
- Post-exploitation
